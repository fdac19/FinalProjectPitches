# Movie ratings and suggestions

We will pull ratings of movies from multiple websites and then based on different metrics and genres, provide a movie suggestion to the user and display the ratings from the different websites. 

We will use APIs if provided, otherwise we will scrape data from the websites and store it in our database. We can connect the database to a webapp which the user can then use to look up movie ratings from difference sites or ask for suggestions about a movie.
