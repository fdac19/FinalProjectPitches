Searching nutrition facts of certain foods can be a little tedious at times. Information on the food that you search for nutrition facts can be thrown all over the page at times and sometimes the source doesn't find the specific search. The plan is to conduct a process in which a food is entered, and searches are made on multiple sources to find the nutrition information, and return it to the user in an orderly fashion and later used for comparision amongst other food products.
