This project is fairly simple, but still in development. If anyone would like to work on
this and add on, then I will gladly make this my final project too!

Given a few repos and free comic web viewing I had planned on developing an algorithm to 
scrap for a certain hero or villian throughout the repos. This would consist of image and text
analysis. 

Once data has been scrapped per character, then there would be another algorithm to begin working
on creating a bio from the character dialogue and possible actions in the image. The biopgrahies 
could consist of origins (based on series), likes, dislikes, beliefs, known associates, etc. 

More features for character analysis could be added on. I figured this would be a good base case
for the tool to have. Oh, this is a tool to search for a given character or a list of characters.
If given a database we could also just fill in all possible heroes; However, this could grow to 
be very large so I thought the tool would be easier to manage. 

P.S. Sorry for the poor grammar
