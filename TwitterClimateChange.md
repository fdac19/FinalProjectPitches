# Analyzing tweets on Climate Change/power outages

CURENT is collecting tweets containing climate change and electric power
keywords as part of an ongoing project to analyze the impact of a power outage
caused by a natural disaster on social media platforms. As of writing, there
are almost 1B tweets with power keywords, and almost 45M on climate change. The
problem is that most of these tweets are just noise; very few of the tweets
collected with power keywords actually involve the power grid.

We need a good method for separating the relevant tweets from the irrelevant
ones. Furthermore, we need to analyze the tweets that are relevant in the
context of the this project (e.g. What is the sentiment? Is it in response to
a natural disaster?)
