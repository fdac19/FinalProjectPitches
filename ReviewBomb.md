"Review Bomb" Pitch:

The summary is as follows: Look on video game and/or movie websites (still debating) that allow user reviews and determine
whether a review with a low score is legitimate or a review bomb.

For scores below a certain score threshold, the length of a review, consistent terminology and "unprofessional" words expressing
discontent will determine whether a review provides actual criticism.  Also considering looking at positive reviews
to allow certain terminology to be acceptable for lower scores if they appear there as well.

Preferably, this will be done without looking into the accounts of people who clearly are review bombing a product.
The goal of this project is for the system to determine this based on the review alone.

Also, after these "useless" reviews are removed, calculate the "actual" user rating.

This pitch is open to suggestions and/or changes, so do not hesitate to provide feedback.
