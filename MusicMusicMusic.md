This project is fairly straightforward. We're going to do something with music lyrics and other parameters. Right now, we're sort of thinking that we want to try and predict a song's genre, year, and artist. This is hardly final. We're defintely going to try and expand the project's scope as we go.

Our current project plan:

Step 1- Dataset Acquisition: http://millionsongdataset.com/ - Should be good to go on that

Step 2- Analysis: We're currently debating what we want to do here. As mentioned above, we might try parsing out artist, year, and/or genre, but we're definitely gonna look at other paraameter as well once we get started.

Step 3- Prediction: The end goal is create some model that will take novel song lyrics and be able to identify it in some way. At this point, we're pretty flexible as to how we get here.

Also, we have a full team at this point:

Sean Toll, 
Ethan Grissom, 
Josh Dunkley, 
Thomas Keyes
