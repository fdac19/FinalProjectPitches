InterPlanetary Spider

Our project pitch is to crawl the IPFS network, create a connection graph, and analyze that. We will project the connection graph on a map of the world. This will allow us to visualize an advanced new peer-to-peer network that aims to be the future of the internet. We may also analyze the presence of certain files on nodes.

Team members: Jake Lamberson, Tim Wells, Rachel Weeks, and Nolan Brown

We are not looking for more team members. We already have the dream team.
