# Discord Text Analyzer

The idea of this project is to create a Discord bot that would be invited into a server and then perform different kinds of 
text analysis on all the messages sent currently and in the past by different members in the server. The easiest thing to start 
with would be to see what are the most sent messages and emotes per user. Then more advanced technics could be preformed with 
looking at overall text info for the server and interesting ways to visualize this.
